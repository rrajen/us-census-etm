# Salesforce Enterprise Territory Model Example

## Model Description

This model is based on US Census Regions, Divisions and States. The intent was to fulfill a need of a
realistic and non-trivial territory hierarchy that can be used for whatever purposes you deem fit.
The model will be deployed as a planning model under the name US_Census.

Deploy it to your Sandbox environment first and *not* to Production directly.
